The mini-review is aimed at narrating the recent developments and challenges while incor porating AI into the contemporary healthcare. In 2023, a surge of 133.7% was seen in research publications in volving the role of AI in various fields of healthcare, with main focus in radiology, gastroenterology, and ophthal mology. Some of the most commonly laid challenges with AI revolve around consistency and reliability of data, algorithm bias, and ethical as well as privacy concerns. Addressing the challenges at hand around the utilization and role of AI in healthcare systems is of utmost priority as development of targeted and adaptable medical tools can transform the global healthcare in the future.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_02\nTitle: Explainable AI in Healthcare: to Explain, to Predict, or to Describe\nAuthors: Alex Carriero, Anne de Hond, Bram Cappers, Fernando Paulovich, Sanne Abeln\nAbstract:\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are designed to provide information about how AI-based models make predictions. In healthcare, there is a widespread expectation that these methods will provide relevant and accurate information about a model’s inner workings to di!erent stakeholders (ranging from patients and healthcare providers to AI and medical guideline developers). This is a challenging endeavor since what qualifies as relevant information may di!er greatly depending on the stakeholder. For many stakeholders, relevant explanations are causal in nature, yet, explainable AI methods are often not able to deliver this information. Using the Describe-Predict-Explain framework, we argue that Explainable AI methods are good descriptive tools, as they may help to describe how a model works but are limited in their ability to explain why a model works in terms of true underlying biological mechanisms and cause-and-e!ect relations. This limits the suitability of explainable AI methods to provide actionable advice to patients or to judge the face validity of AI-based models.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_03\nTitle: Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Akanksha Saini, A J Meitei, Kh.

Effective management of these diseases is crucial for improving patient outcomes, minimizing complications, and reducing healthcare costs. Traditional approaches to chronic disease management often rely on periodic patient visits and manual data entry, which can lead to delayed interventions and suboptimal care. AI-driven predictive models offer a promising solution by leveraging large-scale healthcare data to forecast disease progression, identify high-risk patients, and provide personalized treatment recommendations. Machine learning algorithms, particularly those in supervised learning (e.g., regression analysis, support vector machines, random forests) and deep learning (e.g., neural networks), can analyze complex patterns in patient data, such as medical history, lifestyle factors, genetic predispositions, and real-time biometrics. These models enable the early detection of health deteriorations, facilitating proactive interventions and personalized care strategies. The integration of AI-driven predictive models in chronic disease management not only supports clinical decision-making but also empowers patients to take an active role in their care through real-time monitoring and tailored health plans. Despite promising advances, the implementation of AI models faces challenges related to data privacy, model transparency, and the need for continuous validation in diverse populations. However, as AI continues to evolve, it holds significant potential to revolutionize chronic disease management by enhancing predictive accuracy, reducing healthcare costs, and improving overall patient well-being\nPaper ID: AI_Health_06\nTitle: Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning\nAuthors: KM Jyoti Rani\nAbstract:\nDiabetes is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide health care crisis. According to International Diabetes Federation 382 million people are living with diabetes across the whole world. By 2035, this will be doubled as 592 million. Diabetes is a disease caused due to the increase level of blood glucose. This high blood glucose produces the symptoms of frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. Diabetes is a one of the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, amputations, heart failure and stroke. When we eat, our body turns food into sugars, or glucose. At that point, our pancreas is supposed to release insulin. Insulin serves as a key to open our cells, to allow the glucose to enter and allow us to use the glucose for energy. But with diabetes, this system does not work. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the most common forms of the disease, but there are also other kinds, such as gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy, as well as other forms. Machine learning is an emerging scientific field in data science dealing with the ways in which machines learn from experience. The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques. The algorithms like K nearest neighbour, Logistic Regression, Random forest, Support vector machine and Decision tree are used. The accuracy of the model using each of the algorithms is calculated. Then the one with a good accuracy is taken as the model for predicting the diabetes. Keywords : Machine Learning, Diabetes, Decision tree, K nearest neighbour, Logistic Regression, Support vector Machine, Accuracy.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_07\nTitle: Machine Learning and AI in Cancer Prognosis, Prediction, and Treatment Selection: A Critical Approach\nAuthors: Bo Zhang, Huiping Shi, Hongtao Wang\nAbstract:\nCancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. While progress has been made in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancer patients, individualized and data-driven care remains a challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI), which is used to predict and automate many cancers, has emerged as a promising option for improving healthcare accuracy and patient outcomes. AI applications in oncology include risk assessment, early diagnosis, patient prognosis estimation, and treatment selection based on deep knowledge. Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from training data, has been highly effective at predicting various types of cancer, including breast, brain, lung, liver, and prostate cancer. In fact, AI and ML have demonstrated greater accuracy in predicting cancer than clinicians. These technologies also have the potential to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and quality of life of patients with various illnesses, not just cancer. Therefore, it is important to improve current AI and ML technologies and to develop new programs to benefit patients. This article examines the use of AI and ML algorithms in cancer prediction, including their current applications, limitations, and future prospects.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_08\nTitle: Healthcare Data Using Machine Learning Models\nAuthors: Dr Amit Singhal, Vivekanandan G E\nAbstract:\nThe extensive use of computer-based technology in the health care industry has resulted in the accumulation of electronic data. The challenges faced by medical practitioners in the study of symptoms and early sickness detection stem from the substantial amount of data that has to be processed.

The primary aim of this research is to discern trends in the diagnosis of illnesses through the use of several supervised machine learning models. This will be achieved by assessing performance metrics associated with these models.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_09\nTitle: AI-Driven Healthcare: Predictive Analytics for Disease Diagnosis and Treatment\nAuthors: Sreepathi Ramesh Babu, NBS Vijay Kumar,A.Sri Divya ,B.Thanuja\nAbstract:\nThe integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has ushered in a new era of predictive analytics for disease diagnosis and treatment. AI-driven healthcare predictive analytics leverages vast amounts of medical data, employing advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify patterns and predict health outcomes. This approach enhances diagnostic accuracy, enables early detection of diseases, and personalizes treatment plans, thereby improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare resources. AI models can analyze diverse data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), medical imaging, and genetic information, to provide comprehensive insights into patient health. Despite its potential, the implementation of AI in healthcare faces challenges such as data privacy concerns, the need for large, high-quality datasets, and the integration of AI systems into existing clinical workflows. This abstract reviews the current state of AI-driven healthcare predictive analytics, highlights key advancements, and discusses the challenges and future directions for the effective use of AI in disease diagnosis and treatment. By addressing these challenges, AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, making it more predictive, precise, and personalized.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_10\nTitle: Disease Prediction Using Graph Machine Learning Based on Electronic Health\nData: A Review of Approaches and Trends\nAuthors: Haohui Lu, andShahadatUddin\nAbstract:\nGraph machine-learning (ML) methods have recently attracted great attention and have made significant progress in graph applications. To date, most graph ML approaches have been evaluated on social networks, but they have not been comprehensively reviewed in the health informatics domain. Herein, a review of graph ML methods and their applications in the disease prediction domain based on electronic health data is presented in this study from two levels: node classification and link prediction. Commonly used graph ML approaches for these two levels are shallow embedding and graph neural networks (GNN). This study performs comprehensive research to identify articles that applied or proposed graph ML models on disease prediction using electronic health data. We considered journals and conferences from four digital library databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, ACM digital library, and IEEEXplore). Based on the identified articles, we review the present status of and trends in graph ML approaches for disease prediction using electronic health data. Even though GNN-based models have achieved outstanding results compared with the traditional ML methods in a wide range of disease prediction tasks, they still confront interpretability and dynamic graph challenges. Though the disease prediction field using ML techniques is still emerging, GNN-based models have the potential to be an excellent approach for disease prediction, which can be used in medical diagnosis, treatment, and the prognosis of diseases.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_11\nTitle: Predicting Individual Disease Risk Based on Medical History\nAuthors: Darcy A. Davis, Nitesh V. Chawla, Nicholas Blumm, Nicholas Christakis, Albert-László Barabási\nAbstract:\nThe monumental cost of health care, especially for chronic disease treatment, is quickly becoming unmanageable. This crisis has motivated the drive towards preventative medicine, where the primary concern is recognizing disease risk and taking action at the earliest signs. However, universal test ing is neither time nor cost efficient. We propose CARE, a Collaborative Assessment and Recommendation Engine, which relies only on a patient’s medical history using ICD 9-CM codes in order to predict future diseases risks. CARE uses collaborative filtering to predict each patient’s greatest disease risks based on their own medical history and that of similar patients. We also describe an Iterative version, ICARE, which incorporates ensemble concepts for improved performance. These novel systems require no specialized in formation and provide predictions for medical conditions of all kinds in a single run. We present experimental results on a Medicare dataset, demonstrating that CARE and ICARE perform well at capturing future disease risks.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_12\nTitle: Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Comprehensive Framework for Clinical Implementation\nAuthors: Rajendra Prasad Urukadle\nAbstract:\nPredictive analytics and machine learning models are revolutionizing healthcare management by enabling proactive intervention strategies through sophisticated data analysis. This article explores the integration of machine learning algorithms with historical health data to forecast potential health events and risks, providing healthcare providers with powerful tools for anticipatory care. Examining the fundamental architecture, implementation challenges, and clinical validation methods of these predictive models, it demonstrates their transformative impact on healthcare delivery. This article highlights the importance of robust model development, seamless clinical workflow integration, and adherence to regulatory requirements while addressing critical concerns regarding data privacy and ethical considerations. It suggests the successful deployment of predictive analytics in healthcare settings can significantly enhance patient outcomes and resource allocation efficiency while establishing a framework for future advancements in personalized medicine.

This systematic review aimed to collect and assess the impact and success of AI technologies across various healthcare domains. Methods: A systematic search of major databases (including PubMed, Scopus, and ISI) was conducted for articles published up to 2023. Keywords related to AI-driven disease detection, classification, and prognosis were used. Non-English articles or those with inaccessible full texts were excluded. Data was extracted by two researchers, and the quality of selected articles was evaluated based on the strengths and limitations stated by the authors. Results: In total, 123 articles were included. AI contributions were categorized into three areas. For disease detection (n=75), Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was the most frequent topic (n=18), followed by oncology. Chest X-rays were the most common input (n=15). In disease classification (n=23), oncology (especially breast cancer) was the most researched field (n=7), primarily using breast imaging. For prediction and prevention (n=25), oncology was again the most studied category, with clinical and laboratory parameters being the most utilized input (n=12). Conclusion: AI-driven clinical decision support systems (CDSS) exhibit strong diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in imaging and laboratory settings. However, many models function as “black boxes,” which limits interpretability and clinician trust. Data bias and challenges in integrating AI tools into practice also persist. The findings suggest that future work should focus on explainable AI and rigorous real-world validation to safely implement these tools in healthcare.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_14\nTitle: A Review on Disease Prediction Using Artificial Intelligence\nAuthors: Pallavi Patil , Kirankumari Patil\nAbstract:\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) can be used for disease prediction in various ways. AI can analyze medical images such as X rays, MRI scans, CT scans, and mammograms to detect abnormalities and identify potential diseases. This can help in early detection and diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. AI can analyze electronic health records (EHRs) to identify patterns and correlations in patient data.

This can help identify early signs of diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and sleep apnea.AI can analyze patient symptoms and medical history through natural language processing (NLP) to identify potential diseases. This can help healthcare professionals to make a more accurate diagnosis and recommend suitable treatments. Overall, AI has the latent to revolutionize disease prediction by enabling early detection and proactive intervention, which can mend patient outcomes and moderate healthcare costs.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_15\nTitle: Intelligent Heart Disease Prediction System Using Data Mining Techniques\nAuthors: Sellappan Palaniappan, Rafiah Awang\nAbstract:\nThe healthcare industry collects huge amounts of healthcare data which, unfortunately, are not “mined” to discover hidden information for effective decision making. Discovery of hidden patterns and relationships often goes unexploited. Advanced data mining techniques can help remedy this situation. This research has developed a prototype Intelligent Heart Disease Prediction System (IHDPS) using data mining techniques, namely, Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes and Neural Network. Results show that each technique has its unique strength in realizing the objectives of the defined mining goals. IHDPS can answer complex “what if” queries which traditional decision support systems cannot. Using medical profiles such as age, sex, blood pressure and blood sugar it can predict the likelihood of patients getting a heart disease. It enables significant knowledge, e.g. patterns, relationships between medical factors related to heart disease, to be established. IHDPS is Web-based, user-friendly, scalable, reliable and expandable. It is implemented on the .NET platform.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_16\nTitle: Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Heart Disease Prediction\nAuthors: Ruby Hasan\nAbstract:\n In the last few years, cardiovascular diseases have emerged as one of the most common causes of deaths worldwide. The lifestyle changes, eating habits, working cultures etc, has significantly contributed to this alarming issue across the globe including the developed, underdeveloped and developing nations. Early detection of the initial signs of cardiovascular diseases and the continuous medical supervision can help in reducing rising number of patients and eventually the mortality rate. However with limited medical facilities and specialist doctors, it is difficult to continuously monitor the patients and provide consultations. Technological interventions are required to facilitate the patient monitoring and treatment. The healthcare data generated through various medical procedures and continuous patient monitoring can be utilized to develop efficient prediction models for cardiovascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular illnesses can aid in making decisions on life-style changes in high hazard sufferers and in turn lessen the complications, which may be an outstanding milestone inside the field of medicine. This paper studies some of the most widely used machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction by using the medical data and historical information. The various techniques are discussed and a comparative analysis of the same is presented. This report compares five common strategies for predicting the chance of heart attack that have been published in the literature. KNN, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest are some of the approaches used. Further, the paper also highlights the advantages and disadvantages of using the various techniques for developing the prediction models.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_17\nTitle: Heart Disease Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms\nAuthors: Sri Sai Saran Reddy Yeturu, Vergin Raja Sarobin M, Jani Anbarasi, Mohith Krishna Gunapathi, Helen D\nAbstract:\n Generally, the most complicated task in the healthcare field is the diagnosis of the disease itself. The diagnosis phase in disease detection is usually the most time-consuming task and is prone to most of the errors. Such complications can be effectively handled if the disease detection process is well automated by incorporating effective machine learning algorithms trained with some benchmark datasets. It should also be noted that huge amounts of data that are acquired from Heart Specialization Hospitals are being wasted every year. In this paper, various classification algorithms have been used to train the machine to diagnose heart disease. By a comparative study of various learning models, we have identified the appropriate learning model for the heart disease dataset. Initially, the work will begin with an overview of various machine learning algorithms followed by the algorithmic comparison.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_18\nTitle: Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning\nAuthors: Ahad Rehman, Shikha Singh, Vineet Singh, Bramah Hazela\nAbstract:\nMachine learning advancements have spurred a revolution in healthcare by making it possible to create prediction models for early disease diagnosis. This report introduces the Multiple Disease Prediction System (MDPS), a state-of-the-art approach that uses machine learning to forecast the likelihood of several diseases based on patient data, including medical history, lifestyle, and demographics. The MDPS addresses the growing difficulties in healthcare by focusing on the early detection of multiple diseases. Some of its crucial components include data preparation, feature selection, model training and disease Detection. Despite advantages like early detection and cost savings, dealing with data privacy, model interpretability, and continuous improvements is essential for MDPS's ethical and efficient usage in healthcare. As a result, MDPS has a significant po tential to enhance public health and minimize the difficulties associated with chronic illnesses.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_19\nTitle: Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms\nAuthors: Kalapraveen Bagadi, Visalakshi Annepu, Adnan Naji Jameel AL-Tamimi, Rabab Alayham Abbas Helmi\nAbstract: \nThe fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death worldwide highlights the significance of accurate prediction for successful preventative and treatment measures. Machine learning algorithms, which use the analysis of vast patient data to reveal hidden patterns and risk variables, have recently come to light as potential techniques for CVD prediction. This study intends to analyse how machine learning (ML) techniques are used in CVD prediction and evaluate how well they perform in comparison to conventional approaches. The study makes use of a sizable patient cohort's medical history, demographic data, and clinical factors in a complete dataset. Predictive models are built using a variety of machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting, K-nearest neighbours, naive Bayes classifier, and logistic regression. To find the most important factors influencing CVD risk, feature selection techniques are used. Metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve are used to assess how well the machine learning models work. The outcomes are contrasted with well known risk prediction models and clinical guidelines in order to assess the added value of machine learning methods. This work intends to improve CVD prediction capabilities and offer useful insights for better risk assessment and management strategies by utilizing the power of machine learning.\nPaper ID: AI_Health_20\nTitle: Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Intrusion Detection System\nAuthors: Mohammad Almseidin, Maen Alzubi, Szilveszter Kovacs, Mouhammd Alkasassbeh\nAbstract:\nIntrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the implemented solutions against harmful attacks. Furthermore, attackers always keep changing their tools and techniques. However, implementing an accepted IDS system is also a challenging task. In this paper, several experiments have been performed and evaluated to assess various machine learning classifiers based on KDD intrusion dataset. It succeeded to compute several performance metrics in order to evaluate the selected classifiers. The focus was on false negative and false positive performance metrics in order to enhance the detection rate of the intrusion detection system. The implemented experiments demonstrated that the decision table classifier achieved the lowest value of false negative while the random forest classifier has achieved the highest average accuracy rate.",

INTRODUCTION  \n \nDiabetes is the fast growing disease among the peop le \neven among the youngsters .  \nIn understanding diabetes and how it develops, we \nneed to understand what happens in the body \nwithout diabetes. Sugar (glucose) comes from the foods that we eat, specifically carbohydrate foods. \nCarbohydrate foods provide our body with its main \nenergy sour ce everybody, even those people with \ndiabetes, needs carbohydrate. Carbohydrate foods \ninclude bread, cereal, pasta, rice, fruit, dairy products \nand vegetables (especially starchy vegetables). When \nwe eat these foods, the body breaks them down into \nVolume 6, Issue 4, May -June -2020  | http:// ijsrcseit.com   \n KM Jyoti Rani  Int J Sci Res CSE & IT, July-August -2020 ; 6 (4) : 294-305 \n \n295 glucose.  The glucose moves around the body in the \nbloodstream. Some of the glucose is taken to our \nbrain to help us think clearly and function. The \nremainder of the glucose is taken to the cells of our \nbody for energy and also to our liver, where it is \nstored as e nergy that is used later by the body. In \norder for the body to use glucose for energy, insulin \nis required. Insulin is a hormone that is produced by \nthe beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin works like a \nkey to a door. Insulin attaches itself to doors on the  \ncell, opening the door to allow glucose to move from \nthe blood stream, through the door, and into the cell. \nIf the pancreas is not able to produce enough insulin \n(insulin deficiency) or if the body cannot use the \ninsulin it produces (insulin resistance), glucose builds \nup in the bloodstream (hyperglycaemia) and diabetes \ndevelops. Diabetes Mellitus means high levels of \nsugar (glucose) in the blood stream and in the urine.  \n \nTypes of Diabetes  \n \nType 1  diabetes means that the immune system is \ncompromised and the cells fail to produce insulin in \nsufficient amounts. There are no eloquent studies \nthat prove the causes of type 1 diabetes and there are \ncurrently no known methods of prevention.  \n \nType 2  diabet es means that the cells produce a low \nquantity of insulin or the body can’t use the insulin \ncorrectly. This is the most common type of diabetes, \nthus affecting 90% of persons diagnosed with \ndiabetes. It is caused by both genetic factors and the \nmanner of l iving.  \n \nGestational  diabetes appears in pregnant women who \nsuddenly develop high blood sugar. In two thirds of \nthe cases, it will reappear during subsequent \npregnancies. There is a great chance that type 1 or \ntype 2 diabetes will occur after a pregnancy af fected \nby gestational diabetes.  \n \n Symptoms of Diabetes  \n \n• Frequent Urination  \n• Increased thirst  \n• Tired/Sleepiness  \n• Weight loss  \n• Blurred vision  \n•  Mood swings  \n• Confusion and difficulty concentrating  \n• frequent infections  \n \nCauses of Diabetes  \nGenetic factors are the main cause of diabetes. It is \ncaused by at least two mutant genes in the \nchromosome 6, the chromosome that affects the \nresponse of the body to various antigens.  \nViral infection may also influence the occurrence of \ntype 1 and type 2 diabetes. Studies have s hown that \ninfection with viruses such as rubella, Coxsackievirus, \nmumps, hepatitis B virus, and cytomegalovirus \nincrease the risk of developing diabetes.  \n \nII. LITERATURE REVIEW  \n \nYasodhaet al.[1] uses the classification on divers e \ntypes of datasets that can be  accomplished to decide if \na person is diabetic or not. The diabetic patient’s data \nset is established by gathering data from hospital \nwarehous e which contains two hundred instances \nwith nine  attributes. These instances of this dataset \nare referring to two  groups i.e. blood tests and urine \ntests. In this study the implementation can be done \nby using WEKA to classify the data and the data is \nassessed by means of 10 -fold cross validation \napproach, as it performs very well on small datasets, \nand the outcomes a re compared. The naïve Bayes, J48, \nREP Tree and Random Tree are used. It was \nconcluded that J48 works best showing an accuracy \nof 60.2% among others.  \n \nVolume 6, Issue 4, May -June -2020  | http:// ijsrcseit.com   \n KM Jyoti Rani  Int J Sci Res CSE & IT, July-August -2020 ; 6 (4) : 294-305 \n \n296 Aiswaryaet al.

The research hopes to propose a faster \nand more efficient method of identifying the disease \nthat will help in well -timed cure of the patients. \nUsin g PIMA dataset and cross validation approach \nthe study concluded that J48 algorithm gives an \naccuracy rate of 74.8% while the naïve Bayes gives an \naccuracy of 79.5% by using 70:30 split.  \n \nGupta et al. [3] aims to find and calculate the \naccuracy, sensitivit y and specificity percentage of \nnumerous classification methods and also tried to \ncompare and analyse the results of several \nclassification methods in WEKA, the study compares \nthe performance of same classifiers when \nimplemented on some other tools which i ncludes \nRapidminer and Matlabusing the same parameters \n(i.e. accuracy, sensitivity and specificity). They \napplied JRIP, Jgraft and BayesNet algorithms. The \nresult shows that Jgraft shows highest accuracy i.e \n81.3%, sensitivity is 59.7% and specificity is 8 1.4%. It \nwas also concluded that WEKA works best than \nMatlab and Rapidminner . \n \nLee et al. [4] focus on applying a decision tree \nalgorithm named as CART on the diabetes dataset after applying the resample filter over the data. The \nauthor emphasis on the cla ss imbalance problem and \nthe need to handle this problem before applying any \nalgorithm to achieve better accuracy rates. The class \nimbalance is a mostly occur in a dataset having \ndichotomous values, which means that the class \nvariable have two possible out comes and can be \nhandled easily if observed earlier in data \npreprocessing stage and will help in boosting the \naccuracy of the predictive model.  \n \nIII.

We shall also explain our proposed \nmethodology to improve the accuracy . Five different \nmethods were used in this paper. The different \nmethods used are defined below. The output is the \naccuracy metrics of the machine learning models.  \nThen , the model can be used in prediction.  \n \nDataset Description  \nThe diabetes data set was originated from  \nhttps://www.kaggle.com/johndasilva/diabetes . \nDiabetes dataset containing 2000  cases. The objective \nis to predict based on the measures to predict if the \npatient is diabetic or not.  \n \n \n \n➔ The diabetes data set consists of 2000 data points, with 9 features each . \n➔ “Outcome” is the feature we are going to predict, 0 means No dia betes, 1 means diabetes.  \n\nVolume 6, Issue 4, May -June -2020  | http:// ijsrcseit.com   \n KM Jyoti Rani  Int J Sci Res CSE & IT, July-August -2020 ; 6 (4) : 294-305 \n \n297  \n➔ There is no null values in dataset.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \nProposed Model Diagram  \nIV.

It shows how each feature and label is distributed along different ranges, which \nfurther confirms the need for scaling. Next, wherever you see discrete bars, it basically means that each of these \nis actually a categorical variable. We will need to handle thes e categorical variables before applying Machine \nLearning. Our outcome labels have two classes, 0 for no disease and 1 for disease.  \n \nBar Plot For Outcome Class  \n \n\nVolume 6, Issue 4, May -June -2020  | http:// ijsrcseit.com   \n KM Jyoti Rani  Int J Sci Res CSE & IT, July-August -2020 ; 6 (4) : 294-305 \n \n299 The above graph shows that the data is biased towards datapoints having outcome value as 0 where it means \nthat diabetes was not present actually. The number of non -diabetics is almost twice the number of diabetic \npatients . \nk-Nearest Neighbors : \nThe k -NN alg orithm is arguably the simplest machine learnin g algorithm. Building the model consists only of \nstoring the training data set. To make a prediction for a new data point, the algorithm finds the closest data \npoints in the training data set, its “nearest nei ghbors.”  \nFirst, let’s investigate whether we can confirm the connection betwee n model complexity and accuracy:  \n \nThe above plot shows the training and test set accuracy on the y -axis against the setting of n_neighbors on the x -\naxis. Considering if we choose one single nearest neighbor, the prediction on the training set is perfect. But \nwhen more neighbors are conside red, the training accuracy drops, indicating that using the single nearest \nneighbor leads to a model that is too complex. The best performance is somewhere around 9 neighbors.  \n \nTraining Accuracy  0.81 \nTesting Accuracy  0.78 \nTable -1 \nLogistic regression : \nLogistic Regression is one of the most common classification algorithms.  \n \n \n \n\nVolume 6, Issue 4, May -June -2020  | http:// ijsrcseit.com   \n KM Jyoti Rani  Int J Sci Res CSE & IT, July-August -2020 ; 6 (4) : 294-305 \n \n300  \n Training Accuracy  Testing Accuracy  \nC=1 0.779  0.788  \nC=0.01  0.784  0.780  \nC=100  0.778  0.792  \nTable -2 \n➔ In first row, t he defau lt value of C=1 provides with 77 % accuracy on the training and 78 % accuracy on \nthe test set.  \n➔ In second row,  using C=0.01 results are 78%  accuracy on both the training and the test sets . \n➔ Using C=100 results in a little bit lower  accuracy on the tr aining set and little bit highest accuracy on the \ntest set, confirming that less regularization and a more complex model may not generalize better than \ndefault setting.  \nTherefore, we should choose default value C=1.  \n \n  \n\nVolume 6, Issue 4, May -June -2020  | http:// ijsrcseit.com   \n KM Jyoti Rani  Int J Sci Res CSE & IT, July-August -2020 ; 6 (4) : 294-305 \n \n301 Decision Tree : \nThis classifier creates a decision tree based on which, it assigns the class values to each data point.

It is a number between \n0 and 1 for each feature, where 0 means “not used at all” and 1 means “perfec tly predicts the target”.   \n \nFeature “Glucose” is by far the most important feature.  \nRandom Forest : \n\nVolume 6, Issue 4, May -June -2020  | http:// ijsrcseit.com   \n KM Jyoti Rani  Int J Sci Res CSE & IT, July-August -2020 ; 6 (4) : 294-305 \n \n302 This classifier takes the concept of decision trees to the next level. It creates a forest of trees where each tree is \nformed by a random selection of features from the total features.  \nTraining Accuracy  1.00 \nTesting Accuracy  0.974  \nFeature importance in Random Forest : \n \nSimilarly to the single decision tree, the random forest also gives a lot of importance to the “Glucose” feature, but \nit also chooses “BMI” to be the 2nd most informative feature overall.  \nSupport Vector Machine : \n \nThis classifier aims at forming a hyper plane that can separate the classes as much as possible by adjusting the \ndista nce between the data points and the hyper plane. There are several kernels based on which the hyper \nplane is decided.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  \n \nOne of the important real -world medical problems is \nthe detection of diabetes at its early stage. In this \nstudy, systematic efforts are made in designing a \nsystem which results in the p rediction of diabetes. \nDuring this work, five  machine learning classification \nalgorithms are studied and evaluated on various \nmeasures. Experiments are performed on john  \nDiabetes Database. Experimental results determine \nthe adequacy of the designed system wit h an achieved accuracy of 99 % using Decision Tree  \nalgorithm.  \n \nIn future, the designed system with the used machine \nlearning classification algorithms can be used to \npredict or diagnose other diseases. The work can be \nextended and improved for the automation of \ndiabetes analysis including some other machine \nlearning algorithms.  \n \n 0.778 0.774 0.774\n0.482\n00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9\nL I N E A R P O L Y R V F S I G M O I DACCURACY\nKERNELSSVM ACCURACY FOR DIFFERENT KERNELS\nVolume 6, Issue 4, May -June -2020  | http:// ijsrcseit.com   \n KM Jyoti Rani  Int J Sci Res CSE & IT, July-August -2020 ; 6 (4) : 294-305 \n \n304 VI.
